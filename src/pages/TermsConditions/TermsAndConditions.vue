        <h2>General Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to WSID.com. The purpose of this section is so that you know
          your rights as well as ours. While this section is lengthy and boring,
          its purpose is genuine and we try to lay everything out on the table.
          This agreement (“User Agreement” or “Agreement”) between WSID.com
          (“we”, “our,” “us”) and you. This Agreement sets the terms of your use
          of the WSID.com website and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Agreement is a legal contract between you, members of the public,
          and us. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to

        <h2>Use of the Service</h2>
        <h3>Eligibility</h3>

          You may not use the Services, provide any personal information to
          WSID, or otherwise submit personal information through the Services
          (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email

        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Content</h2>
        <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to suspend accounts or take other appropriate
          action when someone’s brand or trademark, including business name
          and/or logo, is used in a manner that may mislead or confuse others
          about your brand affiliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will respond to clear and complete notices of alleged copyright
          infringement.
        </p>

        <h3>Graphic Violence and Adult Content</h3>
        <p>
          WSID allows some forms of graphic violence and/or adult content.
          However, you may not use such content in your profile or header
          images. Additionally, WSID may sometimes require you to remove
          excessively graphic violence out of respect for the deceased and their
          families if we receive a request from their family or an authorized
          representative.
        </p>

        <h3>Unlawful Use</h3>
        <p>
          You may not use our service for any unlawful purposes or in
          furtherance of illegal activities.
        </p>

        <h3>Abusive Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          In order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions
          and beliefs, we prohibit behavior that crosses the line into abuse,
          including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence
          another user’s voice. Context matters when evaluating for abusive
          behavior and determining appropriate enforcement actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious
          physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.
          This includes, but is not limited to, threatening or promoting
          terrorism. You also may not affiliate with organizations that —
          whether by their own statements or activity both on and off the
          platform — use or promote violence against civilians to further their
          causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm. When we receive
          reports that a person is threatening suicide or self-harm, we may take
          a number of steps to assist them, such as reaching out to that person
          and providing resources such as contact information for our mental
          health partners.
        </p>
        <p>You may not promote child sexual exploitation.</p>
        <p>
          You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite
          other people to do so. We consider abusive behavior an attempt to
          harass, intimidate, or silence someone else’s voice
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not direct abuse at someone by sending unwanted sexual
          content, objectifying them in a sexually explicit manner, or otherwise
          engaging in sexual misconduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people
          on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation,
          gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or
          serious disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not use hateful images or symbols in your profile image or
          profile header. You also may not use your username, display name, or
          profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment
          or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not publish or post other people's private information without
          their express authorization and permission. Definitions of private
          information may vary depending on local laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not post or share intimate photos or videos of someone that
          were produced or distributed without their consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may not threaten to expose someone’s private information or
          intimate media. You also may not threaten to hack or break into
          someone’s digital information.
        </p>
